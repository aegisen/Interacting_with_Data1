        <h2><centre>How many individuals in Canada Identify as Indigenous?</centre></h2>
        <p>As shown in this figure, only a small portion of Canadians identify themselves as Indigenous. Out of this already small portion, even fewer identify with 
            certain groups. For example, only 82 thousand individuals identified as Inuit, making up only 0.2% of the total population of Canada. This reflects the small 
            population sizes in America, with only 0.02% identifying as Inuit in America according to <a href = https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2006/dec/censr-28.pdf>
            this</a> report on the 2000 American Census.</p>

        <h2><centre>Where do Canada's Indigenous Populations Live?</centre></h2>
        <p>This graph details the percentage of different population groups in each territory/state of Canada. As expected, Ontario and Quebec both have large
           populations of each, as both of these territories are the most populated in Canada. The locations also make sense contextually for some of the groups. The Métis,
           meaning 'person of mixed race', live in the southern parts of Canada, along the North American border. In the past, French-Canadian fur traders would travel along these 
           borders to parcipate in trade, and some would engage in unionship with the indigenous people at the time. Their children would be called métis, which eventually developed into the 
           full Métis people of today. The Inuit people descended from migrants who settled in Artic and Subartic areas, which is why they are predominately located in the north 
           of Canada.</p>
