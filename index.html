        <center><h2><em>How many individuals in Canada identify as Indigenous?</em></h2></center>
        <p>As shown in this figure, only a small portion of Canadians identify themselves as Indigenous. Out of this already small portion, even fewer identify with 
            certain groups. For example, only 82 thousand individuals identified as Inuit, making up only 0.2% of the total population of Canada. This reflects the small 
            population sizes in America, with only 0.02% identifying as Inuit in America according to <a href = https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2006/dec/censr-28.pdf>
            this</a> report on the 2000 American Census.</p>

        <h2><center><em>Where do Canada's Indigenous populations live?</em></center></h2>
        <p>This graph details the percentage of different population groups in each territory/state of Canada. As expected, Ontario and Quebec both have large
           populations of each, as both of these territories are the most populated in Canada. The locations also make sense contextually for some of the groups. The MÃ©tis,
           meaning 'person of mixed race', live in the southern parts of Canada, along the North American border. In the past, French-Canadian fur traders would travel along these 
           borders to participate in trade, and some would engage in unionship with the indigenous people at the time. Their children would be called mÃ©tis, which eventually developed into the 
           full MÃ©tis people of today. The Inuit people descended from migrants who settled in Arctic and Subartic areas, which is why they are predominately located in the north 
           of Canada.</p>

        <h2><center><em>How Does life compare between Indigenous and Non-Indigenous peoples?</em></center></h2>
        <p>As shown, non-indigenous people tend to have lower food insecurity than their Indigenous peers. Similarly they also tend to have better mental health.
           Among the indigenous groups, Inuits have the highest food insecurity rates, but a much lower level of fair/poor mental health in relation to food insecurity compared
           to the other groups. The First Nation people tend to have the highest rates of both, with the MÃ©tis closely behind. </p>

        <center><p>For each visualization, we added a brief description describing key details from each, as well as some context for certain findings. This context
        helps readers connect with and understand the data better, as opposed to just the visualization. Along with this, we centered certain items so that they are easier to read
        but also visually more pleasing. We also made it so that the hyperlink looks cool when you hover over it, and the text highlights pink! These serve mainly to make things look
            more pleasing, but that presentation is as important as content. In terms of struggles, we hit a language barrier in terms of 'centre' vs 'center', and which one was the proper tag to use in HTML code.ðŸ˜†</p></center>
